# IG MCP Server – SCaLE Materials

This repository houses all the materials needed for the SCaLE (Southern California Linux Expo) presentation on the **Inspektor Gadget MCP Server**.

## About This Talk

Kubernetes can be complex to troubleshoot, especially when it comes to remembering precise CLI commands or piecing together multiple tools. In this talk, we introduce the open source project **Inspektor Gadget** – a CNCF sandbox project whose goal is to simplify Kubernetes observability. Leveraging the power of eBPF, Inspektor Gadget enables users to gain low level visibility into their system within the context they're familiar with like pods, nodes, and namespaces.

In this presentation we'll show you the easiest way to use Inspektor Gadget for troubleshooting – the **Inspektor Gadget MCP Server**. This is an open source project designed to help users investigate and resolve common Kubernetes issues by using natural language queries. Through demo scenarios, we'll show practical examples such as troubleshooting DNS issues, CPU saturation, disk pressure and others. We will also give you a look under the hood to show you how our IG MCP Server orchestrates the suite of observability tools that we affectionately call "gadgets."

This session targets both new and experienced Kubernetes users looking for alternative ways to interact with and understand their clusters. With just a few thoughtful prompts, we can go from the chaos and frustration that comes along with troubleshooting tricky issues to the sense of achievement that is derived from successfully deriving the root cause of an issue. Join us!
